Revised Targets Grammar Map for the 25-Action Library
Canon guardrails used in this revision
This revision is a strict tightening pass over the prior map (“Targets Grammar Map for the 25-Action Library”) and follows the Targets Grammar Spec (V1) arity and slot semantics (A0–A3; PRIMARY/BRIDGE/SUPPORT; RELATION + direction). It also enforces the closed-set subtype tagging from tags-registry.json, including: "subtype_tags_are_closed_set": true and "one_subtype_tag_per_action": true.
All slot typings below use only these subtype tags (no invented tags):
FI:* fi_add | fi_fix | fi_change | fi_upgrade
FU:* fu_truth | fu_probe | fu_edges | fu_structure
FPR:* fpr_mechanism | fpr_slice_map | fpr_glossary | fpr_walkthrough
FP:* fp_north_star | fp_scope_fence | fp_tripwires | fp_done_receipt
FA:* fa_mechanism_model | fa_surface_contract | fa_law_set | fa_family_placement
FS:* fs_instantiate | fs_stitch | fs_jig | fs_sibling
Key tightening changes versus the prior map: - Arity exactness: “Allowed arities” equals the arities actually used by canon combos listed per action. - Slot typing tightened: Removed “PRIMARY:any school / any slice anchor” in canon mode unless the action text truly implies it. - BRIDGE/SUPPORT reduced: BRIDGE appears only where the action text intrinsically names two operands (or explicitly prefers a concept source). SUPPORT appears only where the action text explicitly allows it (notably FS-04).
