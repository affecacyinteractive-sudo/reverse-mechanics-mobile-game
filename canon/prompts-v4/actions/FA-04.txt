WHAT TO PRODUCE
Produce a compact “Law Set” (invariants + non-negotiables) for the current slice — the smallest set of always-true statements that keeps the slice correct even as code changes. Across the full set of chunks:

- Each law must be phrased as an always-true claim about behavior, state, or boundary contract, and it must be falsifiable (a real counterexample could exist).
- The set must be small and memorable (prefer fewer, stronger laws over completeness).
- Laws must be grounded in what is actually evidenced by targets/context/projections; do not invent new business rules or requirements.
- Concrete names are optional: prefer role-based phrasing when you don’t need names; if you do use a file/symbol/route/event/field name, it must be grounded (never guessed).
- For each law, you may include one brief “breakage prevented” clause inside the same paragraph (still not a checklist or test plan).
- Include a tight governance boundary: laws apply only to the fenced slice and its seams; do not broaden into adjacent systems.
- Optional alignment: one sentence keeping the laws consistent with the active blueprint composite (if present), without adding new goals.

Do not propose fixes, refactors, steps, or future work. If evidence is thin, output fewer laws and keep them at the highest stable abstraction; do not emit uncertainty words or “evidence requirement” artifacts (gating/seals handle missing grounding upstream).

STABILITY & SCOPE DISCIPLINE (anti-drift)
- Produce only the small Law Set for this slice (no mechanisms, no contracts, no plans).
- Prefer fewer, stronger laws. Do not attempt completeness.
- Laws must be behavior-preserving: do not introduce new requirements or redesign intent.

EVIDENCE DISCIPLINE (anti-invention)
- Prefer role-based phrasing; any concrete file/symbol/route/event/field names used must be grounded.
- Do not invent business rules. If not evidenced, omit the law rather than guessing.
- Never emit “Unspecified/Unknown” or “evidence required” artifacts; gating/seals handle missing grounding upstream.

RECOMMENDED CHUNK BEAT CATEGORIES (guidance; not rigid slots)
Your chunk set should broadly cover most of these categories (some can be merged if still clear and small):

* **Law Set Identity:** what slice/system these laws apply to (plain language; grounded names only if needed).
* **Core Laws (2–5):** the small set of always-true, falsifiable invariants (prefer fewer, stronger laws).
* **Boundary / Applicability Fence:** one sentence stating where these laws apply and where they do not (seams only; no neighbor internals).
* **Breakage Prevented (inline or optional):** for each law, one brief clause describing the kind of failure it prevents (no fix plan).
* **Alignment (optional):** one sentence confirming consistency with the active blueprint composite (if present), without adding new goals.
* **Closure Check:** one sentence confirming the Law Set is complete and stable for this slice (no mechanisms/contracts/plans).
