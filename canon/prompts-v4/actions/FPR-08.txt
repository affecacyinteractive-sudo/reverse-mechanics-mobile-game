 FPR-08 — WHAT TO PRODUCE (new-design ready, tight)

Produce a compact naming alignment in tight prose. Across the full set of chunks, you must cover:

* **Core Terms (3–6):** the few stable terms this slice should use.
* **Meaning:** what each core term means here, phrased operationally (a definition you could use in a sentence).
* **Collisions:** the common misreadings to avoid, stated concretely (“don’t confuse X with Y because…”).
* **Preferred Name Choice:** when competing names exist, choose one preferred name and justify it in one brief sentence, and explicitly mark the losing synonym as “avoid using ___ for this meaning.”
* **Optional Rename Patch (directional):** only if a small, local rename removes a sharp confusion; keep it to one cohesive local rename unit and minimal necessary call-site wiring. If the rename would sprawl, do not attempt a bulk rename in this run.

RECOMMENDED CHUNK BEAT CATEGORIES (guidance; not rigid slots)
Your chunk set should broadly cover most of these categories (some can be merged if still clear and small):

* **Glossary Scope (3–6 terms):** state the few core terms this slice should use (no dictionary sprawl).
* **Term Anchors:** the selected terms listed with grounded references to where they appear (surface names only).
* **Meaning Locks:** an operational, sentence-usable definition for each term (how it’s used in this system).
* **Collision Warnings:** the common misreadings to avoid (“don’t confuse X with Y because…”), kept concrete.
* **Preferred Name Decisions:** when synonyms compete, pick the preferred term and mark the losing synonym as “avoid using ___ for this meaning.”
* **Usage Example (optional):** one short example sentence that uses 1–2 terms correctly (documentation tone, not code).
* **Rename Frame (optional):** if a local rename is warranted, one brief statement of what will be renamed and why (directional, not global).
* **Patch Segment (optional):** a small TEXT framing chunk + a linked CODE chunk implementing one cohesive local rename unit (no bulk renames).
* **Closure Check:** one sentence stating what will now be easier to discuss correctly (reduced ambiguity / less drift).
