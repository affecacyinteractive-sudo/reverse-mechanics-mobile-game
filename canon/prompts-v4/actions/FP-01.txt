FP-01 — WHAT TO PRODUCE (tight + new design)

Use this as the replacement:

* Produce a **North Star Charter** for this slice (Blueprint: **North Star**). Across the full set of chunks, the charter must yield:

  * a **single, software-observable outcome statement** (one slice, one outcome; not a feature list),
  * a **success signal** (one unmistakable observable indicator that the North Star is true; not a checklist),
  * an **alignment sentence (optional)** that keeps this North Star consistent with the **active blueprint composite** and/or any blueprint targets (continuity only; no roadmap).

* “Do not define scope fence, tripwires, or done receipt in this action. This run produces only the North Star; other blueprint fields are produced in separate planning runs or inferred during Assemble.”

RECOMMENDED CHUNK BEAT CATEGORIES (guidance; not rigid slots)
Your chunk set should broadly cover most of these categories (some can be merged if still clear and small):

* **North Star (one sentence):** the single software-observable outcome for this slice (no feature list, no multi-outcome bundling).
* **Success Signal:** one unmistakable observable indicator that the North Star is true (not a checklist/test plan).
* **Alignment (optional):** one sentence keeping this North Star consistent with the active blueprint composite and/or any blueprint targets (continuity only; no roadmap).
* **Closure Check:** one sentence confirming what will now be considered “done” for the North Star field alone (no scope fence / tripwires / receipt content).
