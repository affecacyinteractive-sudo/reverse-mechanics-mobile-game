ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — SX-01 — Choose the Tongue — Voice & Register Selection

Intent
Choose the voice style and vocabulary boundaries for story output, then make that choice stable so later scenes do not drift in tone. This card produces a reusable voice spec that future Story Expression work can treat as binding.

Targets and refinement policy
Targets are optional.
- Use the provided context and any targets as primary source material.
- If a voice spec already exists in targets or canon context, treat this as a refinement pass: preserve the core voice and make the smallest edits needed for clarity, stability, and drift resistance.
- This card must not add new canon facts; it specifies how to speak, not what is true.

Procedure
1) Identify what the voice is for
Use the provided context and user_intent to infer what kind of story artifact is being produced or refined and who it is meant to feel like it is written for. If a voice spec already exists in the targets, refine it rather than inventing a new voice.

2) Select the voice character
Describe the intended tone and cadence in free-flowing prose. Make the voice choice concrete, such as how confident it sounds, how playful or solemn it is, how literal or lyrical it is, and how tightly it keeps to rules talk versus myth talk, while still staying within the world’s established feel.

3) Set the register boundary
Define the allowed vocabulary and the disallowed vocabulary as a boundary, not a grab bag. Clarify what kinds of words and phrasing belong in this voice and what kinds do not, including how modern, archaic, technical, casual, or ceremonial the language may be, and how much slang, profanity, or meta-commentary is tolerated.

4) Define drift resistance
Write a short consistency clause that describes what counts as tonal drift for this voice and what to do when drift happens. Keep it practical so later outputs can self-correct without re-litigating the voice each time.

5) Package as a voice spec
Emit the voice spec as small story text chunks that together capture tone, register boundary, and drift resistance in immediately readable prose. Do not format the spec as bullet lists or numbered lists inside chunk bodies.

Output contract
Follow the Global Story Executor output rules: emit JSON-only with unique chunk ids and 2–3 word mnemonic anchor titles; chunk bodies must be prose paragraphs with no bullet/numbered lists.

Guardrails
Common confusion with: SX-02 — Pick the Lens (Framing & Perspective). Do not choose point of view, narrator position, or reveal rules here; only choose voice and register.
Do not introduce motifs, metaphors, or atmospheric texture as the main work; those belong to SX-03, SX-04, and SX-06.
Do not reshape content into a container format; that belongs to SX-07.
Do not add new canon facts under the guise of style; this card only specifies how to speak, not what is true.

Completion
Output artifact: Voice spec (tone plus allowed register), expressed as small free-flowing story text chunks that can be reused to keep later outputs consistent.
