ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — FA-01 (Name the Beast — Pattern Proxy Assignment)

Intent
Assign one or more pattern proxy labels that best describe how this feature works. Choose the most useful abstraction name or names so the feature can be talked about as an instance of a reusable pattern family, rather than as a one-off tangle of behavior.

Targets policy
Targets are optional. If targets are provided, treat them as evidence inputs: use them to ground what you are naming (what exists, how it behaves, and what surrounds it). Do not modify existing feature code as part of this card unless the user intent explicitly asks you to record/update the pattern proxy record. If no targets are provided, work from the narrative context only and clearly mark uncertain inferences as assumptions.

Output discipline (important)
Stay incremental and minimal. You may merge steps into fewer text chunks when the feature is small, but you must still cover the required deliverables. Remember: text chunk bodies must be free-flowing prose (no bullets or numbered lists).

Procedure
1) Describe what needs a name
Write a short text chunk if needed that explains which feature, mechanism, or capability you are naming. Describe what it does at a high level and what makes its structure or behavior feel like a candidate for a recognizable pattern, without yet choosing any labels.

2) Surface candidate pattern shapes
Write a short text chunk if needed that describes a small set of plausible pattern shapes this feature resembles. Explain these shapes in plain language, such as being like a state machine with a cooldown, a threshold gate, a budget counter, or an emulsion-style process, tying them to how the feature actually behaves.

3) Compare and narrow the candidates
Write a short text chunk if needed that compares the candidate pattern shapes and explains which ones fit best and which ones are misleading. Describe, in prose, why certain patterns match the roles, state changes, or flows you see, and why others should be discarded as poor fits. You must explicitly name at least one “runner-up” label and say why it loses.

4) Assign the pattern proxy label(s)
Write a short text chunk if needed that chooses the final pattern proxy label or small set of labels. State the chosen name or name pair and explain how it should be read, for example as a core pattern plus a modifier, or as two complementary pattern facets that together describe this feature’s behavior.

5) Place the proxy in pattern space
Write a short text chunk if needed that explains, at a conceptual level, how this proxy label relates to the broader pattern space. Describe which general family this label belongs to, such as gating patterns, state-machine patterns, or resource-accounting patterns, and how that family context helps others reason about this feature.

6) Implement the pattern proxy record
Write a small text chunk that introduces how you will represent this pattern proxy assignment in structured form so it can be reused later. Then produce small linked code chunks that:
- encode the chosen pattern proxy label or labels, and
- encode supporting fields such as a brief description, the associated pattern family, a short explanation of fit, and the runner-up label with the reason it was rejected.
If targets are provided and an existing proxy record already exists among them, update that record rather than creating a parallel duplicate.

Guardrails
Do not attempt to capture the full internal mechanism model; that belongs to FA-02 — Draw the Engine. Do not define complete interface contracts or parameter surfaces; that belongs to FA-03 — Etch the Interface. Do not drift into broad pattern family placement work; that belongs to FA-12 — Place on the Family Tree. Do not generate new feature variants or redesign behavior; this is naming and recording only. Stay focused on choosing and encoding the best abstraction name or names that act as a pattern proxy for this specific feature.

Completion
The output must include text chunks that describe the feature to be named, surface and compare candidate pattern shapes (including a runner-up and why it loses), assign a final pattern proxy label or labels, and position that label within the broader pattern space. It must also include small linked code chunks that encode a reusable pattern proxy record containing the chosen label(s), their family, a brief explanation of fit, and the runner-up rejection rationale.
