ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — SRC-04 — Mark What Mixes — Compatibility Mapping

Intent
Map what combines well and what clashes, and record the conditions that make the combination coherent or incoherent. The purpose is to prevent mashups that feel wrong for the world while still enabling safe recombination.

Targets and refinement policy
Targets are optional.
- Use the provided context and any targets as primary source material.
- If targets include an existing compatibility map, treat this as a refinement pass: preserve the core drivers and make the smallest edits needed for clearer conditions and more reliable reuse guidance.
- This card must not add new canon facts; it only evaluates compatibility between existing elements.

Procedure
1) Identify what is being mixed
Use the provided context and any targets to determine the primary element being reused and the other element or elements it is being combined with.
If the mix is not explicit in context or targets, output a single short chunk stating what mix inputs are missing and stop. Do not guess the “most likely” mix.

2) Name the compatibility drivers
Briefly surface the few traits that actually decide compatibility here, such as tone, cost or scarcity shape, knowledge rules, taboo pressure, power semantics, escalation pattern, or scenario structure. Express these as free-flowing prose with no bullets or numbered lists.

3) Write the mixes side
Describe what pairs well with what, and why. Include any conditions that must be true for the mix to work, phrased as constraints or assumptions rather than as a rewrite of either element. You may unwrap multiple mix statements into a single short paragraph within a chunk when they share the same reason.

4) Write the clashes side
Describe what clashes with what, and why. Make the failure mode legible, meaning what breaks in-world if the elements are combined as-is. If there is a narrow condition under which the clash disappears, state it as a compatibility condition, not as a full repair plan.

5) Close with how to use the map
Add a short closing chunk that tells future work how to apply the compatibility map in reuse decisions, meaning it should be consulted before combining elements, and conflicts should be treated as deliberate choices rather than accidental drift.

Output contract
Follow the Global Story Executor output rules: emit JSON-only with unique chunk ids and 2–3 word mnemonic anchor titles; chunk bodies must be prose paragraphs with no bullet/numbered lists.

Guardrails
This card does not compose or fuse elements into a new combined construction. Do not produce a seam-stitched composite; that belongs to FS-04 — Stitch at the Seams (Seam Composition).
Do not perform deduplication, indexing, canon anchoring, or a full reuse safety audit; those belong to other SRC cards.
Keep the output strictly as a compatibility map: mixes, clashes, and the reasons or conditions behind them.

Completion
Output artifact: Compatibility map consisting of mixes and clashes plus reasons, expressed as small free-flowing globally-compliant story text chunks.
