ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — SX-06 — Paint the Air — Sensory & Atmospheric Rendering

Intent
Add sensory and atmospheric texture without changing facts. Keep the atmosphere consistent with the chosen tone and lens, and use concrete detail to strengthen memory and presence without introducing new canon.

Targets and refinement policy
Targets are optional.
- Use the provided context and any targets as primary source material.
- If targets already contain a strong atmosphere layer, treat this as a refinement and sharpening pass, not a rewrite: preserve the existing palette and make the smallest edits needed for coherence, tone-fit, and truth-preservation.
- This card must not add new canon facts; it only renders what is already true more vividly.

Procedure
1) Identify the surface being enriched
Use the provided context and user_intent (and any targets, if present) to determine what story material is being enriched. Treat the existing content as the source-of-truth.

2) Choose a coherent sensory palette
Decide what sensory qualities define this moment or artifact, including air feel, sound texture, light quality, dominant surfaces, and lingering scent or taste. Keep the palette coherent so details feel like they belong to the same world and mood.

3) Render without smuggling new facts
Add detail that makes what is already true more vivid, not detail that introduces new capabilities, new events, new actors, or new canon rules. If a detail would imply a hidden actor, a new power, a new rule, or a new event, reframe it as impression, ambience, or inference grounded in what is already present.

4) Keep it tone- and lens-aligned
Ensure the sensory layer supports the existing voice and framing rather than fighting them. If the voice is spare, keep details sharp and few. If the voice is lush, keep details rich but controlled, avoiding melodrama unless the tone explicitly calls for it. Respect the chosen lens: do not describe what the narrator would not plausibly register.

5) Package as atmosphere notes
Emit small free-flowing story text chunks that provide an atmosphere layer a writer can reuse. You may include multiple sensory threads in one short paragraph when it stays immediately readable, and you may split into multiple chunks only when doing so prevents density. Do not use bullet lists or numbered lists inside output chunk bodies.

Output contract
Follow the Global Story Executor output rules: emit JSON-only with unique chunk ids and 2–3 word mnemonic anchor titles; chunk bodies must be prose paragraphs with no bullet/numbered lists.

Guardrails
Common confusion with: SX-01 — Choose the Tongue (Voice & Register Selection). Do not select or redefine vocabulary boundaries or voice cadence here; treat voice as upstream and only add sensory texture that fits it.
Do not introduce motifs as meaning-signals; that belongs to SX-03 — Thread the Motifs.
Do not craft a metaphor mask for an abstract mechanism; that belongs to SX-04 — Give It a Mask.
Do not alter plot events, outcomes, or scenario structure; scenario structure belongs to SS cards.

Completion
Output artifact: Atmosphere notes (sensory palette), expressed as small free-flowing globally-compliant story text chunks that add presence without changing underlying facts.
