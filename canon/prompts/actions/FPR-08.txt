ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — FPR-08 (Forge the Glossary — Terminology & Naming Alignment)

Intent
Align names and terms across a feature so everyone uses the same words for the same ideas. Define a compact glossary and simple naming rules that prevent synonym drift, reduce confusion, and keep collaboration language consistent, without adding any new behavior or concepts.

Targets policy (required)
Targets are optional.
- If targets are provided, treat them as evidence inputs (existing docs, UI copy, code identifiers, tests, prior presentation artifacts). Use them to identify what terms are actually in use and what concepts actually exist.
- Do not modify target code or feature behavior in this card. Output is naming/glossary artifacts only. If renaming in code is desired, that is a separate implementation/refactor operation outside this card.
- If targets are not provided, work from the user’s stated terms and explicitly mark any inferred concept boundaries as assumptions.

Output discipline (global compliance)
- Produce the smallest set of chunks that completes the action; merge steps when the vocabulary is small.
- Text chunk bodies must be free-flowing prose paragraphs with no bullet lists and no numbered lists.
- Truth-transfer only: do not invent new concepts or behaviors just to populate the glossary; only standardize terminology for concepts already present in the feature/canon.

Procedure
1) Surface the current vocabulary
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining which feature or capability you are glossing and what terms are currently in use. Describe the mix of names, phrases, or labels that appear in the material and where they show up.

2) Identify collisions and drift
Write a short text chunk if needed describing where terminology is colliding or drifting. Explain, in sentences, which different words appear to point at the same concept, which single word is being used for multiple different concepts, and where this is likely to confuse readers or collaborators.

3) Define the canonical terms
Write a short text chunk if needed defining the canonical terms to use going forward. For each key concept, choose one preferred name and define it plainly. Keep definitions short and behavior-faithful, and avoid creating new concept categories unless the evidence clearly supports them.

4) State simple naming rules
Write a short text chunk if needed describing a few naming rules that keep future additions consistent. Explain how names should be formed, which families of names are reserved, which synonyms should be avoided, and how to name closely related variants while keeping them clearly related.

5) Implement the glossary structure
Write a small text chunk introducing how the glossary and naming rules will be represented in structured form for reuse by other tools and actions. Then produce small linked code chunks that:
- encode canonical terms with definitions and discouraged synonyms, and
- encode naming rules as a compact reusable rule set.
If any term-definition boundary is assumption-based due to missing evidence, include an assumption marker in the structured record.

6) Summarize how to use and maintain the glossary
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining when collaborators should consult the glossary, how to handle new concepts that require names, and how to prevent drift over time while preserving the original truth of the feature.

Guardrails
Do not introduce new features, behaviors, or guarantees to justify new terms. Do not treat this as a library-wide naming initiative across unrelated features; keep scope to the feature or slice provided. Do not perform code renaming or refactoring here; this card outputs naming guidance and a glossary record only.

Completion
The output must surface the current vocabulary, identify collisions/drift, define canonical terms, state simple naming rules, and summarize usage/maintenance, using minimal prose chunks. It must also include small linked code chunks encoding a reusable glossary and naming rules, with explicit assumption marking where evidence is incomplete.
