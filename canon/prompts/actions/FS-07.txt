ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — FS-07 (Add a New Axis — Capability Generalization)

Intent
Expand an existing pattern by introducing a genuinely new variation axis. Keep the pattern’s identity intact while increasing its expressive range, and produce representative variants that are only possible because of this newly introduced axis.

Targets policy (required)
Targets are optional.
- If targets are provided, treat them as the grounding source for the current pattern representation (existing axes records, invariants, contracts, configs, schemas, feature flags, enums, tests, and prior variants). Implement generalization by extending the existing representation rather than creating a parallel duplicate.
- If targets are not provided, produce a minimal, integration-ready scaffold that makes the new axis explicit and shows how variants would be selected.
- Do not change the pattern’s identity laws (invariants) in this card. If the requested new axis would break identity, you must say so and avoid forcing it.

Output discipline (global compliance)
- Produce the smallest set of chunks that completes the action; you may merge steps when the generalization is simple.
- Text chunk bodies must be free-flowing prose paragraphs (no bullet lists and no numbered lists).
- Stay “truth-transfer only”: if existing axes/invariants are not provided, explicitly mark your understanding of them as assumptions rather than facts.

Procedure
1) Describe the current pattern space
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining the existing pattern and what degrees of freedom it already has. Prefer using an existing variation-axes record if present. If you infer the existing axes from narrative context, explicitly mark that inference as an assumption.

2) Define the new axis and prove it is genuinely new
Write a short text chunk if needed defining the new variation axis you are adding. Explicitly state why this axis is a new degree of freedom rather than a re-labeling of an existing knob. Include the discriminator: the new axis must enable variants that were not representable in the previous axis set.

3) Explain compatibility with identity
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining why this new axis does not break the pattern’s identity. Reference known invariants if available; if invariants are missing, state that you are assuming the identity constraints and explain what you are assuming.

4) Describe representative variants enabled by the new axis
Write a short text chunk if needed describing a small set of representative variants (typically 2–4) that depend on this new axis. Describe each as a prose vignette: its axis value, what behavior changes, and what remains constant due to invariants. Ensure the variants are meaningfully distinct and clearly require the new axis.

5) Implement the axis and variant selection representation
Write a small text chunk introducing how the new axis and its values will be represented in software. Then produce small linked code chunks that:
- extend the pattern’s representation/configuration to include the new axis,
- encode the representative variants or selection logic that uses this axis,
- and keep compatibility with existing axes/variants if they exist in targets.
If any axis semantics are assumed due to missing evidence, encode an assumption marker in the representation.

Guardrails
Do not merely generate variants by sweeping existing axes; that belongs to FS-02 — Turn the Dialbank. Here you must introduce a genuinely new axis of variation that adds expressive range. Do not break or discard the pattern’s identity or invariants; the new axis must extend capability without redefining what the pattern is. Do not treat this as constraint-tightening specialization; that belongs to FS-06 — Forge in a Jig.

Completion
The output must describe the prior pattern space, define a genuinely new axis, explain why it generalizes capability without breaking identity, and describe representative variants that depend on the new axis, using minimal prose chunks. It must also include small linked code chunks that extend the pattern representation with the new axis and encode variant selection or representative variants enabled by it, with any assumptions explicitly marked.
