ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — FP-11 (Launch Choreography — Rollout & Adoption Plan)

Intent
Plan how this feature or release enters the world and gets used. Define a staged rollout, the onboarding/help artifacts that support adoption, and what to watch immediately after launch so you can react quickly.

Targets policy (required)
Targets are optional.
- If targets are provided, treat them as evidence inputs (Roadmap Weave milestones, Done Receipt, Tripwire Atlas risks/dependencies, current gating/flag systems, prior launch learnings, support/ops conventions). Use them to keep rollout plans consistent with existing mechanisms and constraints.
- Do not modify target code or feature behavior in this card. Output is a planning artifact plus a structured rollout-plan record only.
- If targets are not provided, work from the user’s described feature and context, and explicitly mark any inferred constraints, audiences, or monitoring capabilities as assumptions.

Output discipline (global compliance)
- Produce the smallest set of chunks that completes the action; merge steps when the plan is simple.
- Text chunk bodies must be free-flowing prose paragraphs with no bullet lists and no numbered lists.
- Keep this as rollout/adoption planning, not scope definition, not acceptance criteria, and not long-term ops ownership.

Procedure
1) Restate what is being launched
Write a short text chunk if needed stating which feature, release, or capability this plan applies to and what outcome it serves, without redoing the roadmap. If story context exists, you may reference it as optional flavor, but the plan must remain operationally clear without it.

2) Describe the rollout posture
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining the rollout posture, such as cautious staged rollout, controlled ramp, or broad launch, and why that posture matches known risks, dependencies, and confidence.

3) Describe the rollout stages
Write a short text chunk if needed describing how the feature moves from first exposure to full availability. Describe the shape of stages in prose, such as internal exposure, small cohort, opt-in, region/shard gates, percentage ramps, and general availability, without committing to specific dates unless provided.

4) Define adoption supports and learning loops
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining what will help people adopt the feature and how feedback will be captured. This can include onboarding guidance, help docs, prompts, tutorials, and support playbooks. If narrative presentation is part of the product, you may include lore-friendly guidance artifacts as optional supports, but they must not change functional truth.

5) Define immediate post-launch watchpoints
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining what will be watched immediately after launch and what constitutes an early warning sign versus a success sign. Tie watchpoints to risks and assumptions when possible, and keep them realistic to the observability available.

6) Encode the rollout plan record
Write a small text chunk introducing how this launch choreography will be represented in structured form for reuse. Then produce small linked code chunks that:
- encode rollout stages as an ordered sequence with brief descriptions and gating notes,
- encode adoption supports as a structured set of artifacts and feedback channels,
- encode post-launch watchpoints as a structured set of signals with “success vs warning” interpretation notes,
with explicit assumption markers where the plan relies on inferred capabilities or constraints.

7) Summarize the choreography
Write a short text chunk if needed summarizing how the feature moves from not-live to live, what support exists to help adoption, and what the team will watch in the first phase to decide whether to continue ramping, pause, or roll back.

Guardrails
Do not redefine milestones or sequencing; that belongs to FP-09 — Roadmap Weave. Do not redefine acceptance criteria or verification; that belongs to FP-10 — Done Receipt. Do not assign long-term ownership, rotations, or operating cadences; that belongs to FP-12 — Stewardship Pact. Do not change feature eligibility rules as a product decision; this card plans rollout shape and adoption supports, not the permanent availability model.

Completion
The output must, using minimal prose chunks, restate what is being launched, describe rollout posture and stages, define adoption supports and learning loops, define immediate post-launch watchpoints, and summarize the choreography. It must also include small linked code chunks encoding a reusable rollout plan record containing stages, supports, and watchpoints with explicit assumption markers where needed.
