ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — SRC-05 — Pin the Labels — Indexing & Retrieval Tags

Intent
Add minimal retrieval metadata to a story element so it becomes easy to find later. Tags must be truthful, compact, stable across reuse, and consistent with the library’s vocabulary. Tags should describe what the element reliably does or enables, not what happens to be true in one scene.

Targets and refinement policy
Targets are optional.
- Use the provided context and any targets as primary source material.
- If targets already include tags for this element, treat this as a refinement pass: preserve the tag vocabulary and make the smallest edits needed for stability, deduplication, and retrieval usefulness.
- This card must not add new canon facts; it only labels an existing element for retrieval.

Procedure
1) Identify what you are tagging
Use the provided context and any targets to identify the specific element being tagged. If no clear element is identifiable from targets or user intent, output a single short text chunk explaining that a target element is required for tagging, and stop.

2) Reuse existing tag vocabulary when possible
If the context already implies a tag vocabulary, prefer reusing those exact tag words rather than inventing near-synonyms. The goal is retrieval consistency, not expressive variety.

3) Choose minimal tags that actually retrieve
Select a small set of tags that will materially help someone retrieve this element later. Tag by stable aspects such as theme, pressure shape, constraint prerequisites, cost profile, tone fit, complexity level, and typical scenario function, but only include categories that genuinely apply.

4) Keep tags truthful and reuse-stable
Only tag what the element reliably implies across reuse. Do not tag speculative “might be used for” possibilities. If a tag would only be true in a specific scenario or under a rare exception, it does not belong. Prefer descriptors that remain true when the element is transplanted into a new context.

5) Package the tags in prose-friendly form
Output the tag set as small free-flowing story text chunks that read like a compact labeling note. Do not format tags as bullets or numbered lists inside chunk bodies; express them as short, readable prose that clearly contains the tag set.

Output contract
Follow the Global Story Executor output rules: emit JSON-only with unique chunk ids and 2–3 word mnemonic anchor titles; chunk bodies must be prose paragraphs with no bullet/numbered lists.

Guardrails
Common confusion with: FPR-08 — Forge the Glossary (Terminology & Naming Alignment). Do not define or normalize the world’s terminology here and do not create a glossary or naming rules. This card only assigns retrieval tags to a specific element.
Do not perform family placement, compatibility mapping, or deduplication; those belong to SRC-03, SRC-04, and SRC-06 respectively.
Do not invent new canon facts under the guise of “useful tags.” Tags must reflect existing, reliable properties of the element.

Completion
Output artifact: Retrieval tag set expressed as small free-flowing globally-compliant story text chunks.
