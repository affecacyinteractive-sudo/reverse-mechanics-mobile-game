ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — SX-05 — Strike the Beats — Rhetorical Emphasis

Intent
Choose what to emphasize and in what rhetorical rhythm. Use contrast and repetition to guide attention without changing truth. These are rhetorical beats, not plot beats, and must not imply capabilities, knowledge, or permissions that canon does not support.

Targets and refinement policy
Targets are optional.
- Use the provided context and any targets as primary source material.
- If targets include an existing emphasis plan, treat this as a refinement pass: preserve the existing anchors and cadence unless they cause drift, and make the smallest edits needed for clarity, truth-preservation, and reuse.
- This card must not add new canon facts; it only shapes attention and pacing over existing material.

Procedure
1) Identify what is being shaped
Use the provided context and user_intent to determine which story material is being emphasized or refined. If targets exist, treat them as the primary anchor for what the emphasis must attach to.

2) Choose the emphasis anchors
Decide what must be highlighted so the reader cannot miss it. Pick a small set of emphasis anchors, such as a constraint that always bites, a cost that must be paid, a taboo that cannot be crossed safely, a truth that is uncertain, or a pressure that drives behavior. Keep anchors faithful to canon and avoid turning them into new facts.

3) Choose the rhythm and cadence
Describe how emphasis should land over the span of the artifact, including where to hit hard, where to soften, and how to pace attention. Use repetition deliberately, specifying what idea should recur and what kind of recurrence it should have, so the emphasis feels intentional rather than accidental.

4) Use contrast to sharpen meaning
Describe what the emphasis should be contrasted against, such as speed versus balance, certainty versus doubt, power versus price, secrecy versus exposure, or escape versus commitment. The goal is to make the highlighted ideas pop without rewriting the underlying content.

5) Run the false-capability check
Ensure that rhetorical emphasis does not accidentally claim new powers, hidden knowledge, guaranteed safety, or free wins. If an emphasized line would be read as a new capability or rule, reframe it as perspective, inference, temptation, or a bounded claim that stays within canon.

6) Package as an emphasis plan
Emit an emphasis plan as small free-flowing story text chunks that describe what to highlight and how to pace it. Do not use bullets or numbered lists inside output chunk bodies, and keep each chunk immediately readable.

Output contract
Follow the Global Story Executor output rules: emit JSON-only with unique chunk ids and 2–3 word mnemonic anchor titles; chunk bodies must be prose paragraphs with no bullet/numbered lists.

Guardrails
Common confusion with: SS-05 — Plot the Beats (Sequence Outline). Do not outline a plot beat sequence, escalation chain, turning point, or resolution structure; this card is about rhetorical emphasis, not plot ordering.
Do not select voice vocabulary or register boundaries; that belongs to SX-01 — Choose the Tongue.
Do not select point of view or reveal rules; that belongs to SX-02 — Pick the Lens.
Do not introduce new canon facts under the guise of emphasis; you may only guide attention within what the canon already supports.

Completion
Output artifact: Emphasis plan describing what to highlight and the cadence for doing so, expressed as small free-flowing globally-compliant story text chunks.
