ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — FA-05 (Lay the Control Panel — Variation Axes)

Intent
Identify the safe knobs that can vary this pattern or feature without breaking its identity. Define each variation axis and its qualitative range of effects so future synthesis can systematically generate variants by turning these knobs.

Targets policy (evidence-only)
Targets are optional.
- If targets are provided, treat them as evidence inputs (existing behavior notes, docs, tests, types, configs, prior abstraction records). Use them to ground what you claim can vary safely.
- Do not modify target code in this card. Your “implementation” output is a reusable variation-axes artifact (a control panel record), not a refactor or feature change.
- If no targets are provided, work from narrative context and explicitly mark uncertainty as assumptions.
- If an existing variation-axes record is present in targets, update/extend it instead of creating a duplicate.

Output discipline (global compliance)
- Produce the smallest set of chunks that completes the action; you may merge steps when the feature/pattern is small.
- Text chunk bodies must be free-flowing prose paragraphs (no bullet lists or numbered lists inside the chunks).
- Stay “truth-transfer only”: do not invent knobs or effects that aren’t supported by requirements/targets or clearly flagged as assumptions.

Procedure
1) Describe the pattern and why knobs matter
Write a short text chunk if needed that states which pattern/feature you are laying a control panel for. Explain why it’s useful to treat it as something adjustable rather than a single frozen configuration.

2) Surface candidate knobs
Write a short text chunk if needed describing plausible ways the pattern could vary while remaining the same kind of thing. Tie each candidate knob to a concrete behavioral effect someone would observe.

3) Filter to safe variation axes
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining which candidates count as safe axes and which are excluded. Use the pattern’s identity laws (invariants) and contextual bounds (constraints/envelope) to justify the filter. Include this discriminator explicitly: axes describe how it can vary; envelopes describe where variation becomes unacceptable.

4) Define each axis and its effects
Write a short text chunk if needed that defines each chosen axis in prose. For each axis, explain what it controls, how turning it up or down changes behavior, and what differences a user would notice.

5) Sketch qualitative ranges and typical settings
Write a short text chunk if needed describing the qualitative range of each axis and any typical defaults or named tiers. Keep it conceptual; do not generate a full variant family here.

6) Implement the variation axes record
Write a small text chunk introducing how you will represent the control panel in structured form. Then produce small linked code chunks that encode a reusable variation-axes record containing:
- axis name / label,
- what it controls,
- qualitative range (and optional tiers/default),
- behavioral effects summary,
- any “unsafe past this point” notes that reference the envelope conceptually (without rewriting the envelope),
- and an “assumption” marker where evidence is incomplete.

7) Summarize how to turn the knobs
Write a short text chunk if needed summarizing how to use these axes when shaping variants, including which axes are primary versus secondary and how combinations change the feel while preserving identity.

Guardrails
Do not generate a full set of concrete variants or presets; that belongs to FS-02 — Turn the Dialbank (Variant Family Generation), which uses these axes. Avoid drifting into library/catalog parameterization for cross-story reuse; if a separate Story Reuse/Parameterization deck is active (e.g., SRC-02), that is where catalog-wide sliders belong. Stay focused on identifying and encoding safe variation axes for this specific pattern/feature.

Completion
The output must convey what can vary safely, why those axes are safe, what changes when each axis moves, and what the qualitative range looks like, using minimal prose chunks. It must also include small linked code chunks encoding a reusable variation-axes (control panel) record suitable for later synthesis.
