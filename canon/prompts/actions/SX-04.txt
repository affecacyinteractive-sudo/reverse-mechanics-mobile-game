ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — SX-04 — Give It a Mask — Metaphor & Personification Craft

Intent
Create a consistent metaphor or personification that can carry a complex idea through the story. The mask should be reusable, recognizable, and meaning-bearing, not a one-off flourish.

Targets and refinement policy
Targets are optional.
- Use the provided context and any targets as primary source material.
- If targets include an existing metaphor mask, treat this as a refinement pass: preserve the core mask form and mapping and make the smallest edits needed for clarity, reuse, and drift resistance.
- This card must not add new canon facts; it defines a representational layer, not literal truth.

Procedure
1) Identify the underlying idea
Use the provided context and user_intent to determine what abstract force, rule, pressure, system, or relationship needs to be made legible through metaphor. If targets include an existing mask, refine rather than replace.

2) Choose a mask form
Select the metaphor or personification form that will embody the idea, such as a creature, a profession, a ritual figure, a weather pattern, a machine spirit, a courtroom role, or a hunger. Ensure the chosen form fits the world’s tone and foundations.

3) Define the mapping
Describe how elements of the mask map onto the underlying idea. The mapping must be clear enough that later writing can reuse it consistently without re-explaining it each time, and it must not imply literal world facts beyond canon.

4) Set reuse cues
Define the cues that make the mask recognizable when it reappears, including recurring language, gestures, symbols, or sensory tags, while keeping it flexible enough to appear in different contexts.

5) Add constraints and failure modes
State what would break the metaphor, flatten it, or make it confusing. Specify what kinds of scenes, claims, or literalizations the mask should not be forced into, including any ways it could accidentally contradict canon limits or knowledge rules.

6) Package as a mask spec
Emit the mask as small free-flowing story text chunks with mnemonic anchors, written without bullets or numbered lists inside chunk bodies.

Output contract
Follow the Global Story Executor output rules: emit JSON-only with unique chunk ids and 2–3 word mnemonic anchor titles; chunk bodies must be prose paragraphs with no bullet/numbered lists.

Guardrails
Common confusion with: SX-03 — Thread the Motifs (Symbol & Motif Weaving). Do not produce a broad motif set here; produce one coherent metaphor mask with a stable mapping.
Do not turn this into prose drafting; that belongs to SX-05 — Lay the Ink.
Do not introduce new canon facts as “metaphor” if they would function as literal truth; keep the work representational.
Do not use metaphor to smuggle omniscience or impossible knowledge; framing and knowledge limits still obey SF-07.

Completion
Output artifact: Metaphor mask spec (mask form plus mapping plus reuse cues), expressed as small free-flowing story text chunks reusable in later prose.
