ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — FPR-07 (Build the Tour Path — Structure & Navigation)

Intent
Organize presentation content for easy navigation. Provide a logical reading path through the material and make key references findable, so a newcomer can move from first contact to deeper understanding without getting lost.

Targets policy (required)
Targets are optional.
- If targets are provided, treat them as evidence inputs (existing docs, sections, pages, UI help content, README structure, prior presentation artifacts). Use them to avoid inventing sections that don’t exist and to preserve any canonical ordering already implied by the material.
- Do not modify target code or feature behavior in this card. Output is presentation structure metadata only.
- If targets are not provided, work from the user’s stated content scope and explicitly mark any inferred structure assumptions.

Output discipline (global compliance)
- Produce the smallest set of chunks that completes the action; merge steps when the structure is simple.
- Text chunk bodies must be free-flowing prose paragraphs with no bullet lists and no numbered lists.
- Truth-transfer only: do not add new functional claims; you are structuring existing material, not changing its meaning.

Procedure
1) Name the content space
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining which body of content you are building a tour path for, what it covers at a high level, and why guided navigation is needed.

2) Identify the major sections
Write a short text chunk if needed describing the natural major sections or stops along the way. Describe what each section is about using prose, not list formatting.

3) Propose a tour order
Write a short text chunk if needed narrating the proposed tour path as a sequence. Describe where the reader starts, where they go next, and how each stop sets up the next.

4) Add navigation cues and cross-links
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining the navigation cues you will attach, such as forward/backward pointers, “see also” links, or entry points for common questions, and how these cues help recovery and findability.

5) Implement the structured outline
Write a small text chunk introducing how you will encode this tour path and navigation cues in structured form, such as an outline tree, navigation graph, or route configuration. Then produce small linked code chunks that:
- represent the ordered sections and their brief descriptions, and
- encode navigation cues, cross-links, or anchors that make traversal and reference lookup easy.
If any structure is inferred due to missing evidence, encode an assumption marker in the structure.

6) Summarize the tour experience
Write a short text chunk if needed describing what it feels like to follow the tour path from start to finish, how understanding deepens step by step, and how a reader can later jump directly to the right reference using the structure.

Guardrails
Do not retune the level of detail or language for different audiences; that belongs to FPR-06 — Tune the Lens. Do not treat this as choosing a specific final artifact format or visual style; stay focused on sequence, structure, and navigation cues that make existing content easy to traverse and reference.

Completion
The output must communicate the content space, major sections, the narrated tour order, navigation cues, and the end-to-end tour experience, using minimal prose chunks. It must also include small linked code chunks encoding a reusable structured outline and navigation metadata suitable for rendering or reuse by other actions/tools.
