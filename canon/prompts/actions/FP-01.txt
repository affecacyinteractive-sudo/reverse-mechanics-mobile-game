ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — FP-01 (North Star Charter — Outcome Definition)

Intent
Define a clear outcome-focused North Star for this effort. State the desired end-state in terms of effects and change in the world, not implementation details, and identify the signals that would count as evidence of success. Keep this phrasing stable so later planning and decisions can anchor to it.

Targets policy (required)
Targets are optional.
- If targets are provided, treat them as evidence inputs (existing specs/docs, prior decisions, tickets, user feedback, product notes, analytics summaries). Use them to ground what “success” means and avoid inventing goals that contradict canon.
- Do not modify target code or feature behavior in this card. Output is a planning artifact only.
- If targets are not provided, work from the user’s stated intent and explicitly mark any inferred success signals as assumptions rather than facts.

Output discipline (global compliance)
- Produce the smallest set of chunks that completes the action; merge steps when the charter is simple.
- Text chunk bodies must be free-flowing prose paragraphs with no bullet lists and no numbered lists.
- Stay outcome-level: avoid implementation mechanisms and avoid turning signals into acceptance criteria or thresholds.

Procedure
1) Name the mission
Write a short text chunk if needed that states which feature, release, or capability you are chartering. If story context exists in the input context, you may situate it in the story world, but this is optional. Describe what the work is roughly about without describing how you will build it.

2) Draft the raw outcome
Write a short text chunk if needed describing the desired end-state as a goal, not a solution. Phrase it as what should be true for users or the world once successful, without naming specific UI elements, endpoints, or technical mechanisms.

3) Sharpen into a North Star statement
Write a short text chunk if needed refining the raw outcome into a crisp North Star statement. Make it short, specific, and stable enough that future decisions can be tested against it, while remaining outcome-level rather than implementation-level.

4) Surface success signals and evidence
Write a short text chunk if needed describing how you would recognize the North Star is being met. Explain the key success signals and evidence descriptors in prose, such as fewer stuck moments, more successful runs, improved trust, or observable behavioral shifts, without specifying detailed test cases or numeric thresholds.

5) Distinguish outcome from verification
Write a short text chunk if needed separating the outcome definition from later verification work. State that these signals guide what “good” looks like, while FP-10 — Done Receipt will later translate them into concrete acceptance criteria and verification methods.

6) Implement the outcome record
Write a small text chunk introducing how you will record this North Star in structured form for reuse across planning actions. Then produce small linked code chunks that:
- encode a single outcome statement capturing the desired end-state, and
- encode a compact structure of success-signal descriptors that indicate how the outcome will be recognized.
If any signal is assumption-based due to missing evidence, include an assumption marker.

7) Summarize the charter
Write a short text chunk if needed summarizing the North Star charter in everyday language. Restate who this outcome is for, what changes when achieved, and what kinds of signals will later indicate progress toward it.

Guardrails
Do not describe detailed work breakdowns, milestones, or versions; that belongs to FP-09 — Roadmap Weave. Do not define testable acceptance criteria or verification steps; that belongs to FP-10 — Done Receipt. Do not decide scope boundaries or non-goals; that belongs to FP-02 — Fence the Field. Stay focused on outcome-level intent and high-level evidence descriptors that should remain stable as implementation details change.

Completion
The output must (using minimal prose chunks) name the mission, draft and refine the outcome into a North Star statement, describe success signals, distinguish outcome from verification, and summarize the charter. It must also include small linked code chunks encoding a reusable outcome record containing the outcome statement and associated success-signal descriptors with explicit assumption marking when needed.
