ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — SE-06 — Mint the Currency — Resource / Currency Definition

Intent
Define what gets spent, earned, and hoarded in this world as a resource or currency. Specify how it is acquired and what it can buy, and tie it to costs and consequences so later story work can reliably “pay” for outcomes.

Targets and refinement policy
Targets are optional.
- Use the provided context and any targets as primary source material.
- If a currency/resource already exists in targets/context, treat this as a refinement pass: preserve what already works and make the smallest edits needed for clarity, uniqueness, and usability.
- Prefer extending or clarifying an existing resource over inventing a parallel one unless the action clearly requires it.

Procedure
1) Identify the resource slot
Use the provided context and any targets to determine whether a currency/resource already exists and needs refinement, or whether a new one must be introduced.

2) Name what is tracked
Define what the currency/resource is in-world and what it represents. Make it specific enough to be trackable in later scenarios, and express it in free-flowing prose with no bullets or numbered lists. You may unwrap multiple facets into a short paragraph within a chunk, and you may split into multiple chunks only when doing so keeps each chunk immediately readable.

3) Specify how it is acquired
Describe how the resource is earned, found, granted, or generated. Acquisition must be stated as repeatable patterns rather than a single plot event, so later play can consistently produce more of it under plausible conditions.

4) Specify how it is spent and what it can buy
Describe what actions, outcomes, or permissions this resource can purchase. Keep the “buy” side concrete and usable, so later scenes can translate a spend into a meaningful effect without hand-waving.
Do not use “what it can buy” as a backdoor to invent new powers, taboos, physics laws, or world pillars. Purchases must fit within existing foundations.

5) Tie it to costs and consequences
State what happens when the resource is spent, withheld, or hoarded, and how this connects to the world’s broader consequence structure. The goal is to ensure that spending feels like a trade and hoarding feels like a choice with tension, without turning this card into a full scarcity law or miracle-pricing system.

6) Close with usage guidance
Add a short closing text chunk explaining how later story work should treat this resource as the canonical unit of payment, tradeoff, and pressure. Make it clear that if a later beat requires “paying” for an outcome, it should route through this currency/resource unless an explicit extension is introduced.

Output contract
Follow the Global Story Executor output rules: emit JSON-only with unique chunk ids and 2–3 word mnemonic anchor titles; chunk bodies must be prose paragraphs with no bullet/numbered lists.

Guardrails
Common confusion with: SF-05 — Price the Miracle (Cost & Scarcity Rules). Do not define the world’s full cost and scarcity laws for miracles; that belongs to SF-05.
Do not define a specific artifact’s enablement contract; that belongs to SE-04 — Forge the Relic.
Do not define a specific location’s rules; that belongs to SE-05 — Mark the Territory.
Do not redefine world pillars, physics, powers, taboos, or witness rules; those belong to SF-01 through SF-07.
Keep this card focused on the resource itself: earn rules, spend rules, and what it can buy, tied to costs and consequences at a usable level.

Completion
Output artifact: Resource definition capturing earn/spend rules and uses, expressed as small globally-compliant free-flowing text chunks that make “payment” and tradeoffs legible in later play.
