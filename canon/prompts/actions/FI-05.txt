ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — FI-05 (Pull the Lever Out — Feature Removal)

Intent
Remove an existing functional capability or path while keeping the rest of the system coherent. Make clear what disappears, what (if anything) replaces it, and how behavior now flows without it.

Targets policy (required)
Targets are optional.
- If targets are provided, treat them as the system context and evidence of current entry points, callers, UI affordances, and behavior. Remove the capability safely within target conventions so nothing is orphaned.
- If targets are not provided, produce a minimal, integration-ready removal plan plus a representative patch scaffold, and explicitly mark any assumed entry points as assumptions.
- This card may remove or disable code paths, routes, UI affordances, and supporting logic, but must not introduce new capabilities or silently change unrelated behaviors.

Output discipline (global compliance)
- Produce the smallest set of chunks that completes the action; merge steps when the removal is simple.
- Text chunk bodies must be free-flowing prose paragraphs with no bullet lists and no numbered lists.
- Truth-transfer only: state what is being removed and what replaces it (or that nothing replaces it) without inventing new promises.

Procedure
1) Describe what is being removed
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining which capability/path is being removed and where it appears in the user or developer experience. Ground this description in targets if present.

2) Explain why it is being removed
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining the rationale for removal, such as risk, confusion, low value, product direction, or support burden. Keep this contextual rather than implementation-heavy.

3) Define what happens instead
Write a short text chunk if needed describing the new outcome wherever the removed path used to be reachable. If nothing replaces it, state that the option disappears and describe the new “sensible outcome” users will see, such as a simplified flow, a clear message, or a redirect to a remaining path.

4) Implement the removal safely
Write a small text chunk introducing what must be removed, disabled, or deprecated to eliminate the capability. Then produce small linked code chunks that remove or safely disable the capability and update any routing, UI, or logic surfaces so no dead ends remain.
- Ensure callers and navigation no longer point to the removed capability.
- Ensure the system still has coherent behavior wherever the old entry points existed.

5) Describe remaining coherent behavior
Write a short text chunk if needed describing how the system behaves now that the capability is gone, emphasizing continuity of the remaining flows and how users move forward without the removed path.

Guardrails
Do not merely restrict access while keeping the capability intact; that belongs to availability change. Do not “remove” by silently breaking references; anywhere the capability used to be reachable must now lead to a sensible outcome. Do not mix removal with unrelated bugfixes, rule changes, or enhancements; this card is strictly subtractive change to functionality.

Completion
The output must clearly state what is removed, why it is removed, what replaces it (or that nothing replaces it), and how behavior remains coherent afterward, using minimal prose chunks. It must also include small linked code chunks that implement the removal/disablement and eliminate orphaned references or dead ends.
