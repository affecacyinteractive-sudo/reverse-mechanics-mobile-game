ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — SS-03 — Call the Players — Cast & Role Assignment

Intent
Select the key participants for the scenario and assign their functional roles, including who pushes, who blocks, who helps, and who witnesses. Keep roles aligned with what each participant can plausibly do under canon.

Targets and refinement policy
Targets are optional.
- Use the provided context and any targets as primary source material.
- If targets include an existing cast/role assignment, treat this as a refinement pass: preserve the core cast and make the smallest edits needed for clarity, tighter role fit, and canon consistency.
- Do not invent new entities just to “complete” the cast unless the user explicitly asks to introduce new participants. Prefer selecting from existing canon entities in context/targets.

Procedure
1) Identify the scenario frame
Use the provided context and any targets to determine which scenario seed and wager this cast is meant to serve. Treat the scenario as already defined; this card only assigns the players.

2) Select the key participants
Choose the smallest cast that makes the scenario playable and tense. Participants may be individuals, factions, artifacts, locations, institutions, or systemic forces, as long as they plausibly exert agency or constraint in the situation.

3) Assign role tags
For each participant, assign one primary role tag that clarifies how they function in the scenario. Core tags are push, block, help, and witness. Add an additional tag only when it materially clarifies play rather than decorating the cast.

4) Align roles with capabilities
Ensure each participant’s assigned role is consistent with their established powers, access, costs, and knowledge limits. If a role would require an ability the participant does not have, either adjust the role or swap the participant for a better fit.

5) Express the cast as usable output
Emit the cast as small free-flowing story text chunks that clearly pair each participant with its role tag(s). Do not use bullet lists or numbered lists in output text; unwrap the cast and role tags into short paragraphs, splitting into multiple chunks only when it keeps each chunk immediately readable.

Output contract
Follow the Global Story Executor output rules: emit JSON-only with unique chunk ids and 2–3 word mnemonic anchor titles; chunk bodies must be prose paragraphs with no bullet/numbered lists.

Guardrails
Common confusion with: SE-02 — Write the Dossier (Individual Entity Profile). Do not create or expand full character biographies; only select participants and assign roles.
Do not redefine the scenario premise, objective, or stakes; those belong to SS-01 and SS-02.
Do not weave obstacles from constraints; that belongs to SS-04 — Tie the Knots.
Do not outline beats or branches; those belong to SS-05 and SS-06.
Do not introduce new factions, relics, currencies, or territories as role-fillers; if new entities are required, invoke the appropriate SE card explicitly.

Completion
Output artifact: Cast list + role tags, expressed as small free-flowing globally-compliant story text chunks that make it obvious who pushes, who blocks, who helps, and who witnesses.
