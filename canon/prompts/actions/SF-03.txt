ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — SF-03 — Write the Physics — Cause & Effect Law

Intent
Define what causes what in the story world. Specify which transformations are allowed, which outcomes are impossible, and what typical side-effects follow from key triggers. The goal is to keep outcomes earned rather than arbitrary, so later story additions feel consistent under the world’s physics.

Targets and refinement policy
Targets are optional.
- Use the provided context and any targets to infer what causal claims already exist.
- If targets include prior physics rules, treat this as a refinement and tightening pass rather than inventing a brand-new physics set.
- Preserve existing laws unless they contradict canon; prefer the smallest edits that increase clarity, coverage, and non-overlap.

Procedure
1) Read the existing causality
Identify any existing cause→effect claims already present in canon context/targets. Treat these as primary source material.

2) Declare the world-level cause→effect laws
Produce a small set of cause→effect laws describing how the world reliably behaves when certain triggers occur.
Each law must read like a law of the setting rather than a one-off plot beat.
State laws in free-flowing prose with no bullets or numbered lists.
You may unwrap multiple laws into a single short paragraph within a chunk, and you may split into multiple chunks only when doing so keeps each chunk immediately readable.

3) Specify allowed transformations and impossible outcomes
For each law, clarify what kinds of transformations are permitted and what outcomes cannot happen in this world.
Impossibilities should feel rooted in pillars and constraints rather than “writer veto,” so later additions cannot sneak in arbitrary outcomes.

4) Include typical side-effects so outcomes feel earned
For each law, add the typical side-effects or tradeoffs that tend to accompany the effect.
The purpose is to prevent “clean wins” and ensure powerful outcomes carry an understandable shadow.
Side-effects may sit adjacent to their law in the same prose paragraph, or appear in a nearby chunk, as long as the association stays obvious.

5) Close with an earnedness reminder
Add a short closing text chunk explaining how later story work should use these laws as the justification layer for outcomes.
Make it clear that when the story produces an effect, it should be traceable to an allowed trigger under these laws.
If an event cannot be justified, the story must either revise the event or explicitly extend the physics.

Output contract
Follow the Global Story Executor output rules: emit JSON-only with unique chunk ids and 2–3 word mnemonic anchor titles; chunk bodies must be prose paragraphs with no bullet/numbered lists.

Guardrails
Do not define step-by-step operational mechanisms with transitions, control loops, or system dynamics; that belongs to SD-02 — Turn the Gears.
Do not define costs and scarcity; that belongs to SF-05 — Price the Miracle.
Do not define taboos and boundary prohibitions; that belongs to SF-06 — Declare the Taboos.
Do not define truth, witness, or knowledge rules; that belongs to SF-07 — Define the Witness.
Keep this card strictly focused on world-level cause→effect laws with allowed transformations, impossibilities, and typical side-effects.

Completion
Output artifact: A small set of world-level cause→effect laws, each with allowed transformations, impossible outcomes, and typical side-effects, written as small free-flowing globally-compliant text chunks that make outcomes feel earned and prevent arbitrary “instant fixes.”
