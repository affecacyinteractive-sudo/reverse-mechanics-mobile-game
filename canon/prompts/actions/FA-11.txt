ACTION CARD SYSTEM PROMPT — FA-11 (Chart the Crash Modes — Failure Envelope)

Intent
Catalog the generic failure shapes for this pattern or feature family and group them into a reusable failure envelope. Include both degrade modes and misfire modes, and describe how each crash mode shows up so later synthesis actions can use this envelope as a risk filter when generating or modifying features.

Targets policy (evidence-only)
Targets are optional.
- If targets are provided, treat them as evidence inputs (tests, docs, known behaviors, prior abstraction records, incident notes if present). Use them to ground what you claim as plausible crash modes and to avoid inventing “facts.”
- Do not modify target code in this card. Your “implementation” output is a reusable failure-envelope record, not runtime enforcement, refactoring, or a feature change.
- If no targets are provided, work from the narrative context and explicitly mark uncertain crash modes, triggers, or signals as assumptions.
- If an existing failure-envelope record exists among targets, update/extend it rather than creating a duplicate.

Output discipline (global compliance)
- Produce the smallest set of chunks that completes the action; you may merge steps when the pattern/family is simple.
- Text chunk bodies must be free-flowing prose paragraphs with no bullet lists and no numbered lists.
- Stay “truth-transfer only”: do not fabricate incident history or pretend you observed failures you did not; describe reusable failure shapes and clearly label any speculative parts.

Procedure
1) Describe the pattern and its risk surface
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining which pattern or feature family you are charting crash modes for. Describe what it does at a high level and where the main risks seem to live in its behavior, such as getting stuck, overacting, underacting, misfiring, or becoming unclear to the user.

2) Surface candidate crash modes
Write a short text chunk if needed describing the range of failure shapes for this pattern. Explain, in prose, the ways it can go wrong, including degrade modes (where it still works but badly) and misfire modes (where it fires at the wrong time, in the wrong way, or not at all). Use behavior-shape language rather than implementation details (for example: “stuck high,” “accidental trigger,” “never triggers,” “unstable over time,” “unclear state,” “oscillates,” “fails silently,” “overreacts,” “underreacts”).

3) Cluster and name the crash modes
Write a short text chunk if needed that groups the candidate failures into a small set of named crash modes. Explain which symptoms belong together under each mode and what each mode’s name means, keeping names tied to recognizable behavior shapes rather than internal architecture.

4) Describe how each mode behaves and escalates
Write a short text chunk if needed that walks through each crash mode and describes how it evolves over time. Explain how it starts, how it presents to an observer (user-facing or externally observable), and how it escalates or degrades, including whether it tends to be silent, noisy, reversible, or sticky once it appears.

5) Map modes to triggers and early signals
Write a short text chunk if needed explaining, at a conceptual level, what tends to trigger each crash mode and what early signals might reveal it. Describe the conditions, usage patterns, or operating contexts that commonly lead into each mode, and the warning signs that show up before full failure.

6) Implement the failure envelope structure
Write a small text chunk introducing how you will represent this failure envelope in structured form. Then produce small linked code chunks that encode a reusable failure envelope record containing, for each crash mode:
- mode name,
- type (degrade or misfire),
- short description of the behavior shape,
- typical symptoms,
- typical triggers,
- early signals,
- and a simple risk/severity tag suitable for synthesis-time filtering.
Mark any entries that are not fully supported by evidence as assumptions.

7) Summarize how the envelope guides synthesis
Write a short text chunk if needed summarizing how this failure envelope should guide future design and synthesis. Describe how pattern users or automated actions can consult these crash modes to avoid risky combinations, watch for known failure shapes, and plan mitigations, without needing to rediscover the same crashes from scratch.

Guardrails
Do not turn this into a detailed, feature-specific boundary map of safe versus unsafe parameter ranges; that belongs to FU-06 — Map the Cliff Edges (Boundary & Failure-Mode Characterization). Here you are capturing generic failure shapes for the pattern or family, not charting one implementation’s numeric thresholds. Do not rewrite core identity laws or constraints; those belong to FA-04 — Write the Laws and FA-06 — Set the Guardrails, which this envelope may rely on but not replace. Do not drift into full incident postmortems or narrative logs; stay focused on reusable crash-mode types, their triggers, and early signals.

Completion
The output must communicate the pattern’s risk surface, surface and cluster failure shapes, name and characterize each crash mode, map triggers and early signals to modes, and summarize how the envelope guides future work, using minimal prose chunks. It must also include small linked code chunks encoding a reusable failure envelope record of crash modes with types, descriptions, triggers, early signals, risk tags, and assumption markers where needed.
